# Rapid Visual Receptive Field Analysis

Visual Receptive Field analysis procedures for *Eiber*, et al., [Rapid Analysis of Visual Receptive Fields by Iterative Tomography](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34799410/), eNeuro (2021). 

This repository provides tools for opening and analysing patch-clamp (current-clamp) data acquired using [HEKA](https://www.heka.com/) in conjunction with visual stimuli provided by EXPO (Peter Lennie), in particular the flashing-bar stimuli which can be used for receptive field reconstruction. 

This code depends on [AIR Tools II](https://github.com/jakobsj/AIRToolsII/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), a collection of Algebraic Iterative Reconstruction methods by Per Christian Hansen and Jakob Sauer Jorgensen.
